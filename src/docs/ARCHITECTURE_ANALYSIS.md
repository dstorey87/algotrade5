- Stores active trades, orders, and trade history
- Uses SQLAlchemy ORM for robust data management
- Supports automatic schema migrations
- WAL mode enabled for better concurrent access

Tables:
- trades: Trade history and active trades
- orders: Order details and status
- trade_custom_data: Custom metadata for trades

### 2. Analysis Database (data/analysis.db)

- Used for performance analysis and strategy optimization

Tables:
- successful_patterns: Tracks pattern trading performance
- backtest_conditions: Records backtest results and conditions
- pattern_performance: Pattern performance across market regimes
