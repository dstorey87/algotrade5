## Session Recovery Instructions
1. Load last known state from current_context
2. Check pending_tasks for next priority
3. Review `changes.log` for latest modifications
4. Verify all dependencies are installed
5. Resume development from the priority task

Remember to check for any system alerts or errors before proceeding.
