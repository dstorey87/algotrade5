# AlgoTradePro5 Architecture Analysis

## System Overview
The system is built on a microservices architecture using Docker containers with the following key components:

1. FreqTrade Trading Engine
   - Core trading logic and execution
   - Strategy implementation
   - Risk management system

2. AI/ML Pipeline
   - Model management from `C:\AlgoTradPro5\models`
   - Real-time inference engine
   - Strategy optimization loop

3. Data Management
   - PostgreSQL database
   - Real-time data processing
   - Historical data aggregation

## Design Decisions

### 1. Database Choice

  - ACID compliance
  - JSON/JSONB support
  - Time-series optimization

### 2. Model Architecture
- Local model hosting for reduced latency
- Pre-downloaded models to ensure reliability
- Quantum loop testing for strategy validation

### 3. Risk Management
- Multi-layer protection:
  - Strategy-level stops
  - System-level circuit breakers
  - Capital allocation limits
