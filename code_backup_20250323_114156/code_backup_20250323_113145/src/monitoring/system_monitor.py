"""
AlgoTradePro5 System Monitor
===========================

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Real-time win rate monitoring (85% target)
- Growth rate tracking (£10 to £1000)
- Quantum validation status
- System health verification
- Performance metrics logging

ALERT THRESHOLDS:
1. Win rate drops below 87%
2. Drawdown exceeds 8%
3. Growth rate below target
4. Pattern validation failures
