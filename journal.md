# AlgoTradePro5 Development Journal

## System Test Results - 2024-03-14 18:00

### Test Execution Summary
- [✅] Directory Structure Validation - Partial Pass
- [❌] Docker Environment Check - Failed
- [❌] Model Availability Verification - Failed
- [❌] Database Connectivity Test - Failed
- [❌] FreqTrade API Check - Failed
- [❌] Environment Variables Validation - Failed

### Critical Issues
1. Core infrastructure not fully initialized
2. Required AI models missing
3. Database configuration incomplete
4. FreqTrade container not running

### Next Actions
1. Initialize core infrastructure
2. Download and configure AI models
3. Setup database schema
4. Configure environment variables
5. Start FreqTrade container

### Command to Fix FreqTrade:
```powershell
cd C:\AlgoTradPro5
docker-compose up -d
```

## System Setup Progress - 2024-03-14 18:30

### Docker Environment Check
- ✅ Docker version 24.0.7 detected
- ❌ No running containers found
- ❌ Missing docker-compose.yml - Created new file

### Action Items Created
1. Created docker-compose.yml with FreqTrade configuration
2. Need to create user_data directory structure
3. Need to create initial config.json
4. Need to implement QuantumAIStrategy

### Next Steps
1. Create required directories and configs
2. Download AI models
3. Initialize database
4. Test FreqTrade container startup

### Error Log
```
[18:30:15] ERROR: docker-compose.yml not found
[18:30:20] ERROR: user_data directory missing
[18:30:25] ERROR: config.json not found
```

## Dependency Management Optimization - 2024-03-14 20:00

### Completed Tasks
- [✅] Created .dockerignore for build context optimization
- [✅] Implemented dependency tracking system
- [✅] Created dependency management script
- [✅] Set up cache cleanup automation
- [✅] Configured version control for dependencies

### System Improvements
1. Build Context
   - Reduced by excluding unnecessary files
   - Implemented size monitoring
   - Added cleanup triggers
   
2. Dependency Management
   - Organized packages by category (core, quantum, ml)
   - Version-locked dependencies
   - Automated cleanup of old versions
   - Local caching with validation

### Next Steps
1. [ ] Validate Docker build with new configuration
2. [ ] Test dependency update workflow
3. [ ] Monitor build context size during development
4. [ ] Document dependency management procedures
5. [ ] Set up automated dependency validation in CI

### Critical Notes
- Keep dependencies/site-packages committed but excluded from Docker build
- Monitor build context size regularly
- Run dependency validation before commits
- Maintain version lock in dependency_manager.json

### Status Overview
- System State: Optimizing
- Build Context: Improving (reduced from 2GB+)
- Next Milestone: Docker build validation

## Cache System Implementation - 2024-03-14 20:30

### Command Execution Results
- ✅ Docker system pruned successfully
- ✅ Created required directories
- ✅ Network "algotradpro5_default" created
- ✅ FreqTrade container started

### System State
- Docker: Clean state
- Cache: Initialized
- FreqTrade: Running
- Network: Connected

### Next Actions
1. [ ] Download initial model cache
2. [ ] Initialize strategy cache
3. [ ] Configure model warm-up
4. [ ] Setup preprocessing cache

### Performance Stats
- Build Context: 156MB (optimized)
- Cache Size: 0B (fresh)
- Container Size: 1.2GB
